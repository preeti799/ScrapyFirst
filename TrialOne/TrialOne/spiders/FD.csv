Maserati Care & Detailing,Polishing Advice,130996,1380,9,8,Tweedy,post-1043906,,,"May 12, 2023",4:47 PM,Hi All. I need some advice on what you consider the best polisher / buffer and which are the best pads and compounds to use for the best shine etc without swirls. I tried to read reviews on line but most are ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù so they are all over the map for recommendations. I also have a Corvette and that forum suggests either Griot‚Äôs Garage or Porter Cable for polishers?? Any help would be appreciated. Happy holidays to all.,1

And it looks good and keeps the value a bit buoyant. If I were to sell it I'd have an auction of Bring a trailer. Auction fees on Mecum and Barrett Jackson are way too high. I go to those shows for fun. Collinite sounds good but I can't be harder than ceramic coat. Ceramic coat a small section of paint on anything and I dare you try to sand it off. That is why it will last at least 5 years.,15

The car looks amazing.,19
